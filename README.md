Learning github

Hello! My name is Sean.
I have been interested in learning coding and developing apps and programs for PC and Android for quite some time.
Over the years I've spent a little time here and there messing around with different SDK's and Developer tools, but never really got far.
I'm having another go at it.
Wish me luck!
